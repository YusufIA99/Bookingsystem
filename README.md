Exzentriq, an internet cafe in Aalborg, has gained popularity but faces uncertainty with available seats. To
address this, a booking system on their website can improve customer experience and operational
efficiency which was our task during this project. We constructed a unfinished bookingssystem for the
netcaf√©, where we in the end summarize our findings and suggest future development options for an
optimal booking system.
